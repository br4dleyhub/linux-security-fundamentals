## Phase 1 – Users & Permissions

A restricted directory was created and protected using file permissions.
A non-privileged user was unable to access protected resources.

This demonstrates the principle of least privilege in Linux.

## Phase 2 – Process and Service Awareness

Running processes and services were observed using system tools.
A test process was created and safely terminated.

This demonstrates the importance of process monitoring in detecting malicious activity.

## Phase 3 – Logging and Auditing

Authentication and system logs were reviewed to observe security-relevant events.
Restricted permissions protect log integrity and support incident investigation.
